## About Us

We believe that in the near future, AI will be deeply embedded into every product, workflow, and daily experience.

It should collaborate, connect, and integrate seamlessly into the world around us — enabling people to truly benefit from its power and potential.

Our mission is to build a unified operating platform that brings together the fragmented AI toolchain into a composable, cooperative system — redefining how AI understands tasks, orchestrates workflows, collaborates across models, and integrates with real-world applications.

Ultimately, we aim to make building and using AI applications feel like working with real software — intuitive, scalable, and accessible to all.
